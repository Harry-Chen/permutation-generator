# Permutation generator

This repo implements the following four permutation generating methods (and their related intermediate number) to calculate the permutation after / before a given one in:

* lexicographical order (with incremental-based number as intermediate number)
* incremental-based number order (with incremental-based number as intermediate number)
* decremental-based number order (with decremental-based number as intermediate number)
* Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter (SJT) algorithm (with decremental-based number as intermediate number)

Obviously it can also be used for generating permutations. See `perm.py` for detailed usage.
