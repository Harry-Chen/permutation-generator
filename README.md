# Permutation generation

This repo implements the following four permutation generation methods (and their related intermediate number):

* lexicographical order (with incremental-based number as intermediate number)
* incremental-based number order (with incremental-based number as intermediate number)
* decremental-based number order (with decremental-based number as intermediate number)
* Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter (SJT) algorithm (with decremental-based number as intermediate number)

See `perm.py` for detailed usage.
